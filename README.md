# Micro2

This is a place to store the code for the Micro 2 Course at Univ of Texas at San Antonio for Spring 2021.  Will upload the files for the basic code to use with the KL25Z freedom board running on MCUXpresso IDE.
The code was developed by modifying the driver examples for the ADC with interrupt and the PWM two chanels files.  These come with a bunch of other files and I will try to up load it as a zip file.[Tilt.zip](https://github.com/Docmo99/Micro2/files/6183917/Tilt.zip)
